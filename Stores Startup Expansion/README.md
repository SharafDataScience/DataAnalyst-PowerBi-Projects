### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Python**  `Startup-Expansion.ipynb`.
 - **Import Libraries**
   - Uses `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation and visualization.
 - **Load Dataset**
   - Reads the Excel file using `pandas.read_excel()`.
 - **Preview and Explore Data**
   - Uses `.info()` and `.describe()` to understand structure, data types, and distributions.
 - **Create New Metrics**
   - Calculates `Profit` and `ROMS%` to evaluate marketing efficiency.
 - **Visualizations**
   - Analyze revenue vs. marketing spend.
   - Compare performance between new vs. old expansion stores.
   - Regional comparison using plots (bar, scatter, box plots).
 - **Insights**
   - Determine the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
   - Identify high-performing regions or stores.
   - Compare returns between new and existing stores.
 - **New Calculated Metrics**
   - `Profit`: Actual earnings from operations.
   - `ROMS%`: Return on every marketing dollar spent.
 - **Export CSV File**
   - After performing the analysis and creating new calculated columns (`Profit` and `ROMS%`), the final processed dataset is saved as a    CSV file:`expansion_startup_new.csv`
